## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above installed on your system. If not installed, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Ensure that pip, Python's package manager, is installed. It usually comes with Python. You can verify by running `pip --version` in your terminal.

### Sunnify Executable (Windows)

If you're using Windows, you can directly download the executable file from [here](/dist/Sunnify%20(Spotify%20Downloader).exe)

### Building from Source

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunnypatell/sunnify-spotify-downloader.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sunnify-spotify-downloader
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r req.txt
```

Run the application:

```bash
python Spotify_Downloader.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the Sunnify application.
2. Enter your Spotify playlist URL in the provided input field.
3. Check show preview box to see progress
4. Check metadata box if you want to download cover art, author, album, release-date etc...
5. Press enter in the URL field to start downloading.
4. The downloaded songs will be saved in the media directory (wherever your source or executable is located).

## Libraries Used

Sunnify utilizes the following Python libraries:

- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/): Used for the GUI interface.
- [webbrowser](https://pypi.org/project/pycopy-webbrowser/): Used to bypass Spotify Network Traffic Detection.
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/): Used for making HTTP requests.
- [mutagen.id3](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/id3.html): Used for editing ID3 tags and scraping metadata.

## Common Debugging

If you encounter any issues while running Sunnify, try the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have a stable internet connection.
2. Verify that you have entered the correct Spotify playlist URL.
3. Check if there are any updates available for Sunnify. You can pull the latest changes from the repository and reinstall the dependencies. `git pull`


# Running the Web App (If you choose not to use the Windows Desktop version)

If you want to run the Sunnify web app locally, follow these steps to set up both the backend and frontend:

### Backend Setup (Sunnify Backend)

1. Navigate to the `web-app/sunnify-backend` directory in your terminal:

    ```bash
    cd web-app/sunnify-backend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies if not done already:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the backend server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

   Alternatively, you can use:

    ```bash
    python -m app.py
    ```

   This will start the backend on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

   The backend communicates with the frontend using **Flask** to create API endpoints and **Flask-CORS** to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing API requests between the frontend and backend across different domains.

### Frontend Setup (Sunnify Web Client)

1. Once the backend is running, navigate to the `web-app/sunnify-webclient` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../sunnify-webclient
    ```

2. Install the required frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   The frontend will now be running locally on `http://localhost:3000` and can communicate with the backend on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Railway Deployment

Deploy the web app (backend + frontend) to Railway using the guide in `RAILWAY.md`.

Quick summary:

- Create two Railway services from these directories:
  - Backend: `web-app/sunnify-backend/`
  - Frontend: `web-app/sunnify-webclient/`
- Set frontend env `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (or `API_URL`) to your backend Railway URL.
- Backend uses `DOWNLOAD_DIR` (defaults to `/tmp/sunnify`).

For detailed steps and notes, see `RAILWAY.md`.

### Important Note

The backend for Sunnify is hosted on Render under the free compute plan. If there hasn't been an API call to the Render-hosted backend for a while, it might "fall asleep" and take a moment to wake up when the frontend sends a request (e.g., downloading a playlist). Please be patient as it may take a few seconds for the backend to wake up and process the request.

## Coming Soon

I'm currently working on integrating Sunnify with iTunes for seamless transfer of downloaded music to iOS devices, specifically adding them to the Apple Music library. Additionally, I'm also working on adding support for Android filesystems to enable direct transfer of downloaded music to Android devices.

Stay tuned for these exciting updates, which will enhance the functionality of Sunnify and provide a more seamless experience for users across different platforms.
